# Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

What was your motivation? My motivation was to be able to have a functioning quiz that allowed interaction with users and feedback.
Why did you build this project? I built this project to be able to apply all the activities we complete in class to see them in action, debug code provided, and have a final product to show the skills I have learned in the past unit.
What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of not having interative webpage and allowing more user customization when they put their name in the scoreboard.
What did you learn? I learned how add buttons to the page and before the code was ruined I also recived feedback. I just was not able to have a score page or have the page function correctly.
